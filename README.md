`lingsem`
=========

`lingsem` is a set of LaTeX macros that are for typesetting semantics (linguistics). Specifically, they are designed (i) to make the typesetting of semantics look, in my opinion, better and (ii) to make the source code more readable. PDF documentation of `lingsem` can be found [here][doc], though you could also just compile the `lingsem-doc.tex` file from the `doc` directory of this repo.[^1]

[^1]: Note that `unified.bst`, available [here][unified], is needed to compile `lingsem-doc.tex`. Alternatively, you could just use your own style instead.
